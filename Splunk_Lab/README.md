## Category  
ðŸ“‚ Defensive Security â†’ SIEM / Log Analysis  

## Objective  
Use Splunk to investigate suspicious events, perform searches, and handle incidents.  

## Tools/Skills Practiced  
- Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL)  
- Querying logs for anomalies  
- Building dashboards and alerts

## Process (Steps Taken)  
1. Connected to Splunk and ingested sample log data.  
2. Ran SPL queries to search for suspicious activity (`index=main failed logins`).  
3. Investigated user accounts tied to brute-force attempts.  
4. Generated alerts and simulated incident response steps.  

## Key Findings  
- Pivoted from failed logins to root-cause investigation.
