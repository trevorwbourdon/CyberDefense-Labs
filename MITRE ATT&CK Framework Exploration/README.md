# MITRE ATT&CK Framework Exploration

## Category  
ðŸ“‚ Defensive Security â†’ Threat Intelligence & Frameworks  

## Objective  
Gain hands-on experience navigating the MITRE ATT&CK framework to identify adversary techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs). Learn how to use ATT&CK to investigate APT groups, map detection opportunities, and explore mitigations.  

## Tools/Skills Practiced  
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator  
- Threat Intelligence research  
- Mapping adversary TTPs to real-world campaigns  
- Understanding detection data sources  
- Identifying mitigations for social engineering and phishing  

## Process (Steps Taken)  
1. Opened the MITRE ATT&CK framework and reviewed tactics/techniques.  
2. Researched spear-phishing (T1566) and noted its detection sources, mitigations, and related groups.  
3. Explored APT groups such as APT29 and Sandworm, reviewing their techniques, software, and C2 frameworks.  
4. Used ATT&CK Navigator to visualize TTP coverage.  
5. Reviewed ATT&CK emulation plans to understand adversary workflows and persistence methods.  

## Key Findings  
- Spear-phishing (T1566) is one of the most widely used techniques, with detection relying on email logs, network monitoring, and endpoint telemetry.  
- Groups like APT29 leverage tools such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter for C2 operations.  
- Mitigation strategies emphasize security awareness training, multi-factor authentication, and monitoring suspicious email traffic.  
- ATT&CK supports blue teams, red/purple teams, and SOC managers to align defenses with real-world adversary behaviors.

## Outcome / What I Learned  
- Developed familiarity with the MITRE ATT&CK framework for mapping adversary TTPs.  
- Learned how ATT&CK supports multiple roles (Blue, Red, Purple teams, and SOC leadership).  
- Practiced extracting threat intelligence to strengthen detection and mitigation strategies.  
- Understood how ATT&CK integrates into SOC workflows for incident detection, response, and threat hunting.
