# Snort: Live Attacks

## Category  
ðŸ“‚ Network Security â†’ Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)  

## Objective  
Create and deploy Snort rules to detect malicious traffic in real time.  

## Tools/Skills Practiced  
- Snort IDS configuration  
- Writing and testing custom Snort rules  
- Detecting attacks in live network traffic  
- Reviewing IDS alert logs  

## Process (Steps Taken)  
1. Configured Snort environment.  
2. Created detection rules for suspicious ports and payloads.  
3. Simulated attacks (Metasploit exploitation, brute-force attempts).  
4. Reviewed Snort logs for alerts.  

## Key Findings  
- Snort successfully flagged simulated Metasploit traffic.  
- Detected brute-force activity in real-time traffic.  
- Learned importance of tuning rules to reduce false positives.

## Outcome / What I Learned  
- Developed practical IDS rule-writing skills.  
- Learned how to detect and respond to simulated intrusions.  
- Gained appreciation for IDS role in layered defense.
